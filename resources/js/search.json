This approach uses minimal code for creating SVGs.","Perfect for non-Ruby developers or automation.

Use this approach if you prefer writing less Ruby.","Subclass","Suitable for building structured, testable SVG objects. This approach integrates Victor within your own class.","When to Choose","While Victor itself is minimal by design, it offers a variety of methods for building SVGs, accommodating different coding styles and project requirements.","You can begin with the basics, using straightforward method calls to define your SVG structure.
